# MedicalChargesPredictor
a machine learning model that uses historical data of people issued by ACME insurance company and it helps to predict the medical insurance charges for the new user

Medical Insurance Charges Prediction
This project aims to predict medical insurance charges for new customers using historical data provided by ACME Insurance Company. The dataset contains demographic and lifestyle information along with the corresponding insurance charges.

By applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and building a Machine Learning model, we can estimate the cost for new users based on similar historical patterns.

📂 Project Overview
Goal: Predict medical insurance charges for new users.

Data: Historical records from ACME Insurance Company.

Approach:

Perform EDA to understand data patterns, correlations, and distributions.

Visualize insights using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Preprocess data for modeling.

Train and evaluate a regression model for prediction.

📊 Technologies & Libraries Used
Python (Core language)

NumPy – Numerical computing

Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib – Data visualization

Seaborn – Statistical data visualization

Plotly – Interactive visualizations

Scikit-learn – Machine learning model building and evaluation

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Checked for missing values and data consistency.

Analyzed relationships between features (e.g., age, BMI, smoker status) and insurance charges.

Created visualizations to identify trends and correlations.

🤖 Machine Learning Model
Model type: Regression (to predict continuous values).

Steps:

Data preprocessing (encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features).

Model training using historical data.

Model evaluation using performance metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R² score.
